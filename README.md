💬 Insta Card - Add Friend Interaction
This project is a simple interactive "Add Friend" card UI similar to Instagram's user interaction behavior. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows toggling between "Stranger" and "Friend" states dynamically when the user clicks a button.

🧩 Features

Interactive button to toggle friend status

on Click:

If Friend → becomes Stranger (red text, button says “Add Friend”)

🔧 How It Works
The HTML creates the basic structure including an image, name, status (<h5>), and button.

The CSS gives the card a clean and centered layout with styling for button and text.

The JavaScript:

Selects the button and status text.

Adds a click event to toggle between two states:

"Stranger" → "Friends"

Changes text color and button label accordingly.
